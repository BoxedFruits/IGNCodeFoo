# IGNCodeFoo
This was my submmission for IGN's internship called Code Foo 2019 
https://www.ign.com/code-foo/2019

The task for the Mobile Application portion was:

1. Using this API (https://ign-apis.herokuapp.com/), pull a list of content and comment counts.
2. Build a native app (iOS or Android) that displays the content and matches the design below as close as possible. Donâ€™t worry about the icons. Each item should open a webview for the corresponding content when tapped, except comments.

Final Submission:
